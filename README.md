Nordic Game Jam 2019. Theme: That again?

## One Sentence Pitch
Civilisation has destryoed the Planet Earth many times before,stop it from happening again!

## Game Summary
You are god. Humans keep making factorys, and global warming is getting worse. You need to destroy their factories before they destroy themselves. If (or when) they do, a new civilisation will rise from their ashes, and you must stop this from happening again!

## Core Mechanics
Click on a factory to destroy it.
The Rate at which factories appear grows over time.
Factories increase Global Warming, which will end the game if it gets too high
If there are no factories, global warming does not increase, but it does NOT go down.
If civilisation dies to global warming, you can restart with a new cilvilsation.

## Gameplay
3D - Spin the globe around to find factories and destroy them
2D - You can see the whole world, and dont need to look around for them.
